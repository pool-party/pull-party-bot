    Hey! I'm a PullPartyBot!

    I can manage different parties inside your chat and tag their members whenever you need!

    You can start by creating a new party in your chat with /create command
    Or try to tag admins with default @admins party

    It would be very kind of you to promote me to admin, so I could tag the parties implicitly right in your messages

    Type /help for more information
